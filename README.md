Self Driving Car Simulation using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a project that employs
an evolutionary algorithm to evolve artificial neural networks for controlling car movements in a virtual
environment, aiming to achieve autonomous driving behavior. NEAT allows networks to grow in complexity,
adapting and improving their structure over generations to optimize driving performance.
